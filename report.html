  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
      Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.       report.html does not count toward the five, but index.html does.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have completed this requirement through having an about, contact, exhibitions, portfolio, and index[.html] page. We the navigation bar to link to each other
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages).
      </p>
      <p>
        We have completed this through favicon.png and the use of link rel="icon" on each page which puts the favicon image we have selected on each page.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your site must include some sort of header.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each page contains a header with the name of the page. Example, the contact page has the header Contact
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the use of the div class, 'navlinks', we have a navigation bar with links to each of our pages and the currnent page on each page.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).
      </p>
      <p>
        Through checking the width of the screen we detect screen size and adjust the website accordingly. How we do it is different for each page, but where we do so we have the comment 'mobile rules'. We increase or decrease text size, delete images, reformat style from horizontal to verticle, among other changes on each page.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, users with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
      </p>
        We have images on every page on the desktop version of the sight, and every image has alt text.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.
      </p>
      <p>
        In style.css, we set the body to use Times New Roman and the navlinks we have set as using sans-serif
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contact.html, we have an nonfunctional form that the user inputs their name and email. It uses verification for the email through the html of having the type be email.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Your site must include links to external sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the exhibitions page, we link to different websites which are galeries that contact Picasso pieces. 
      </p>
    <li>



  <p>
  Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu ValidatorLinks to an external site. and WAVE Web Accessibility EvaluatorLinks to an external site..
  Your site must be available at https://<yourusername or your partner's username>.github.io/343-s23-p1
  In https://<yourusername or your partner's username>.github.io/343-s23-p1/report.html, write a brief report containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above, and linking to the PDF of your design sketch.

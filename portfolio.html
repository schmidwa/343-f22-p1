        <p>Guernica is a large oil painting, considered to be one of Pablo
          Picasso's famous paintings. Several critics and art enthusiasts regard this painting as a very powerful and
          moving
          anti-war image of history and Picasso's best work.</p>
        <p>The white, black and grey painting shows suffering created through chaos and violence. Although you have to
          be
          rather discerning to notice the contents of the painting, it shows a stabbed horse, a dead baby along with a
          screaming woman and a mutilated soldier and flames.</p>

        <p>This painting was made when Picasso was suffering from poverty. Although he got immense success in the
          earlier
          year,
          he quickly ran out of funds and was again one with the poverty surrounding him. In this painting, Picasso
          reflects upon the experiences he had from visiting a women's prison.</p>
        <p>His inspiration for this painting was the murals painted by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes inside the Pantheon.
          Much
          like one of the drawings in the mural, this painting, too, showed a woman helping another from starving on the
          street. However, even in the original mural, Picasso was the one who sketched this scene.</p>

        <p>During the summer of 1931, Picasso visited the French Riviera Resort and painted a series of beach scenes,
          one of which is this. This painting is said to be inspired by the painter's liaison with a 19-year old model
          and his deteriorating terms with his then-wife, Olga.</p>
        <p>This is one of Picasso's famous paintings that aptly show Pablo Picasso's painting style and how he
          implements
          intricate details in plain sight. This painting portrays two mantis-headed beings sitting together.
          This painting was quite popular with the surrealists, mainly because of the animal's habit of eating the male
          partner after intercourse and how it produced yet another visual metaphor.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Created in France, The Weeping Woman depicts one of Picasso's mistresses, Dora Maar.
          This painting came at the end of a series he dedicated to the Guernica Bombing. However, he was really
          intrigued with the subject of this painting and revisited it quite a number of times throughout that year.
          This painting has good reason to be Pablo Picasso's most famous painting as it was the most elaborate one of
          the series. You can visit it in London at Tate Modern.</p>

            <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso is a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer. One of the most
                influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of
                constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop
                and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war
                painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces
                during the Spanish Civil War.</p>

            <p>Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through
                his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented
                with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse
                motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who
                subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.</p>

            <p>Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his life, Picasso has achieved universal renown and immense
                fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and has become one of the best-known figures in
                20th-century art.</p>

            <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso is a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer. One of
                the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the
                invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that
                he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles
                d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of
                Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.</p>

            <p>Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner
                through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as
                he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the
                older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful
                rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern
                art.</p>

            <p>Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his life, Picasso has achieved universal renown and
                immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and has become one of the best-known
                figures in 20th-century art.</p>

            <p>From the beginning of his career, Picasso has displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind, and
                has demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled him to work in several styles at once. For
                example, his paintings of 1917 included the pointillist Woman with a Mantilla, the Cubist Figure in an
                Armchair, and the naturalistic Harlequin (all in the Museu Picasso, Barcelona). In 1919, he made a
                number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect his interest in the stylistic conventions
                and static character of posed photographs. In 1921, he simultaneously painted several large
                neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition Three Musicians (Museum of Modern Art,
                New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art). As Picasso said, "The several
                manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown
                ideal of painting... If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of
                expression I have never hesitated to adopt them."</p>

            <p>The medium in which Picasso has made his most important contribution was painting. In his paintings,
                Picasso uses colour as an expressive element, but relies on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to
                create form and space. He sometimes adds sand to his paint to vary its texture. Much of his painting is
                done at night by artificial light.</p>
